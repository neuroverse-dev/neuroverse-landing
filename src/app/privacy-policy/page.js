                aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with
                interested third parties, to assist such parties in
                understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for
                certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions,
                and/or functionality available through the NeuroVerse. Generally,
                these disclosures are made under terms comparable to this
                Privacy Policy, and the recipients are limited to using the
                information for the purpose for which it was provided. As
                allowed by applicable law, we may also share certain personal
                information among our affiliates and joint marketing partners
                for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. <br />
                It is NeuroVerse&apos; practice to require such third parties to
                handle information in a manner consistent with NeuroVerse
                policies. These third-party companies are authorized to use the
                information only as necessary to provide these services.
                NeuroVerse will only transfer such information to third parties
                that contractually agree to protect such data in a manner that
                is no less restrictive than NeuroVerse&apos; own standards for the
                protection of its own personal information. <br /> <br />
                <b>Third-party websites.</b> <br />
                NeuroVerse&apos; websites may, from time to time, provide links to
                other third-party websites which are outside our control and not
                covered by this Policy and may be different from this Policy. We
                strongly suggest that you review the privacy policies posted on
                all referenced third-party websites. We are not responsible for
                the content of any websites that are not affiliated with us, any
                use of those websites, or the privacy practices of those
                websites <br /> <br />
                We may link to third-party content (e. g., promotions) that is
                sponsored by or co-branded with an identified third-party. In
                these instances, the third-party may obtain information that you
                voluntarily submit to participate in a site activity. NeuroVerse
                is not responsible for information collected by third parties in
                this manner, nor the collection or use of information by other
                sites to which the site is linked. In addition, our site may
                contain links to other sites whose information practices may be
                different than ours. You should consult the other sites&apos;
                privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is
                submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. <br />{' '}

                <b>Service quality monitoring.</b>
                <br />
                Certain transactions may also involve you contacting us, or
                NeuroVerse contacting you. Please be aware that it is
                NeuroVerse&apos; general practice to monitor and in some cases
                record calls for training or quality assurance purposes. <br />
                <b>How we protect personal information.</b>
                The security of your personal information is important to us,
                but despite our efforts, we cannot promise that our security
                program will always eliminate all possible security risks, and
                our liability is limited as set forth in the Terms. <br />
                NeuroVerse uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard and
                protect the security of all data, inclusive of any personal
                information collected by NeuroVerse from you through the
                website(s). NeuroVerse maintains certain administrative, technical
                and physical safeguards in an effort to protect the security of

                Information and other data are stored in hosted and secured
                environments which utilize accepted industry standards for data
                security. NeuroVerse uses commercially reasonable efforts to
                partner with third-party service providers that meet accepted
                industry standards to support the collection, storage, hosting,
                processing and retention of data, inclusive of personal
                information. <br />
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, NeuroVerse cannot, however, ensure,
                warrant or guarantee that the information collected will not be
                accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by system malfunction
                or circumvention of our safeguards. <br />
                It is also important for you to comply with the access controls
                (e.g., username/password management) and other applicable
                provisions of the Terms to protect against unauthorized access
                to your account and to the devices you use to access the
                Site(s). <br /> <br />

                to solicit or attract children under the age of 13. NeuroVerse
                does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or
                send them requests for personal information. <br /> <br />
                <b>EU residents.</b>
                This website and our services are not directed to residents of
                the EU and we do not offer services to residents of the EU{' '}

                <b>Updates to our privacy policy.</b> <br />
                NeuroVerse may, in its sole discretion, update this Privacy Policy
                periodically without prior notice to you to reflect changes in
                our Personal Information practices or with respect to applicable
                laws. We will post the updated version on our website(s) and
                indicate at the top when it was last updated. <br />
                Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any
                changes to this Privacy Policy. In the event that the

                hereunder, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to
                notify you of the change. Our amended Privacy Policy will
                automatically take effect upon the date that an update is
                published, except that (a) we will not, without your consent,
                use your previously collected Personal information in a manner
                inconsistent with the Privacy Policy in effect when we received
                that information, and (b) if you do not agree with any changes
                to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account ceasing
                use of the website(s). Your continued use of the website(s)
                after the revised or updated Privacy Policy has become effective
                indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the
                then-current version of the Privacy Policy. <br />
